<h2>Resume for my application for the position of Director of Rumor Confirmation</h2>
</br>
</br>
<p>Hi. My name is Kevin and I am an ideal fit for this job.  As I understand, loose lips can sink ships, but not if there
  is a Director of Rumor Confirmations aboard.  Personally, I have the skills to:
 <ul>
  <li>Find rumors</li>
  <li>Confirm the rumors if true</li>
  <li>not deny the false rumors</li>
 </ul>
and it is my best skill to execute these in the proper order, which would be:
 <ol>
   <li>Find the rumor</li>
   <li>Observe the rumor's content</li>
   <li>proceede accordingly</li>
 </ol>
As I understand, as the Director of Rumor Confirmation, it will be out of the scope of my job to confirm or deny false
 rumors, and that I should only refer the one who possesses the rumor to the Director of Rumor Denial.  With these
 qualities, I believe I will be properly suited for this job.
</p>
